In this repository I have created my version of a hangman game for my UW Coding Bootcamp course.

This version of hangman or word guess game, I have decided to curate mine with a Seattle Mariner theme. For each word that you guess, it would be the name of a Mariner Great which I have included the following players: Ken Griffey Jr, Alex Rodriguez, Dan Wilson, Ichiro Suzuki, Felix Hernandez, Edgar Martinez, Joey Cora, and Kazuhiro Sasaki. I decided to have the user guess their most famous name which was typically their last minus Ichiro Suzuki's. His stayed as "Ichiro".

I have included a number of lives for the user to have remaining before you lose. 1 live = 1 letter guessed. I have supplied the user with 8 total lives before losing the game or not guessing the name completely. There is a "WINS" category and a "LOSSES" category which would keep track of the user's record throughout interaction.

This project is simply ran with HTML, CSS, Javacript, and GoogleFonts. I used Google Fonts to style my page and give it more of a baseball theme to it.

Throughout this project I really enjoyed the CSS portion, and was greatly challenged with the Javascript part of this project having little to no experience with JS. Now, I can say that I have gotten a much better understanding of Javascript and how functions, for loops, and arrays all do to bind together an interactive website.
