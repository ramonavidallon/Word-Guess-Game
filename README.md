<h1> Word Guess Game </h1>

<h2> Origin </h2>

<p>  This version of hangman or word guess game, I have decided to curate mine with a Seattle Mariner theme. For each word that you guess, it would be the name of a Mariner Great which I have included the following players: Ken Griffey Jr, Alex Rodriguez, Dan Wilson, Ichiro Suzuki, Felix Hernandez, Edgar Martinez, Joey Cora, and Kazuhiro Sasaki. I decided to have the user guess their most famous name which was typically their last minus Ichiro Suzuki's. His stayed as "Ichiro".</p>

<h2> Objective | Rundown </h2>

<ul>
  <li> The user gets 8 lives or 8 letter guesses to solve the missing Seattle Mariner superstar! 1 live = 1 letter guessed.    </li>
  <li> I have created a scoreboard that will keep track of each of the user's wins and losses. </li>
  <li> Once the user types out the name correctly, a picture of the Mariner legend will populate as a reward for winning the game. </li>
 </ul>
  
<h2> Technologies Used </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Javascript </li>
  <li> CSS </li>
  <li> HTML </li>
  <li> Google Fonts </li>
</ul>

<h2> Reflection </h2>

<p> Throughout this project I really enjoyed the CSS portion, and was greatly challenged with the Javascript part of this project having little to no experience with JS. Now, I can say that I have gotten a much better understanding of Javascript and how functions, for loops, and arrays all do to bind together an interactive website.</p>
